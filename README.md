# Shoreside Excalibur TypeScript & Webpack


## Publishing

* Run `npm run build:dev` to produce Javascript bundles for debugging in the `dist/` folder
* Run `npm run build:prod` to produce Javascript bundles for production (minified) in the `dist/` folder

The `dist/` folder can be deployed to a static web host. We recommend [Netlify](https://netlify.com) or [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) since they are free to use.
